A client/wrapper for foursquare's sparse geocoding / reverse geocoding server Twofishes (https://github.com/foursquare/twofishes).

## Fork Info
The [original gem](https://github.com/masone/twofishes-ruby) does not cover bulk capabilities of the thirft server. This repo adds the ability for bulk reverse geocode.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twofishes'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
$ gem install twofishes
```

## Configuration

```ruby
Twofishes.configure do |config|
  config.host = '127.0.0.1' # server address
  config.port = 8080 # thrift port
  config.timeout = 3 # request timeout in seconds
  config.connect_timeout = 0.5 # connection timeout in seconds
  config.retries = 2 # how many times to retry a request
end
```

Request timeouts are enforced per-try, so if you have a timeout of n and do m retries, the total time it could take is n*m.

## Usage

Use the following methods to geocode / reverse geocode.

```ruby
Twofishes::Client.geocode('Ljubljana')
Twofishes::Client.reverse_geocode([0, 0])
```

Use the following method to bulk reverse geocode.

```ruby
# as coordinates, accepts the array of anything that can be used in reverse_geocode
Twofishes::Client.bulk_reverse_geocode([[0, 0], [34.063201, -118.441029]])
```
                                      
If you want the Twofishes server to return fields that are not included by default, you can pass `geocode` an Array of `ResponseIncludes` constants, illustrated by the example below.

```ruby                                      
Twofishes::Client.geocode('Zurich', includes: [ResponseIncludes::PARENTS])
```

Additional options are directly passed to the Twofishes server. You can for example give a language hint by doing:

```ruby
Twofishes::Client.geocode('Zurich', lang: 'de')
```

For more parameters, have a look at the [Twofishes' GeocodeRequest](https://github.com/foursquare/twofishes/blob/master/interface/src/main/thrift/geocoder.thrift#L303) struct.
